Introduction

Chosen Story: The "Town Musicians of Bremen" (German: Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten) (http://www.gmsdinkelscherben.de/downloads/erasmus/bremen.pdf)

The basic premise is that four animals travel to Bremen to play in a band, and on the way to Bremen they encounter a house full of robbers. They enter the house, and essentially fight off the robbers. We took this basic premise, and used the four levels to represent each character, and they must collect the instruments to "defeat" the robbers. Basic controls consist of the use of arrow keys (left and right) to move back and forth, and the space bar to jump.
