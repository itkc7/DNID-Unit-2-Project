## Introduction

Chosen Story: The "Town Musicians of Bremen" (German: Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten) (http://www.gmsdinkelscherben.de/downloads/erasmus/bremen.pdf)

The basic premise is that four animals travel to Bremen to play in a band, and on the way to Bremen they encounter a house full of robbers. They enter the house, and essentially fight 
off the robbers. We took this basic premise, and used the four levels to represent each character, and they must collect the instruments to "defeat" the robbers. Basic controls consist 
of the use of arrow keys (left and right) to move back and forth, and the space bar to jump.

## Ideation and Prototyping

Most of our ideation and prototyping came from our preliminary design document (linked above) from our initial assignment for this project. We began to get our art style for the game
as we used AI to develop our sprites and level backgrounds. Furthermore, as mere extremely primitive inspiration, we also very briefly consulted the code we had used in class in the 
Mad Bomber example.

## Suggestions for the future
In the future, animating the characters should be a top priority. Adding movement to each character would bring the game to life and make the gameplay experience much more immersive. In addition, the platforming mechanics should be further developed. This would include technical tweaks, such as making sure platforms don't spawn directly on top of each other and maintaining a minimum distance between them. Expanding the mechanics could also mean introducing different types of platforms with unique properties, or varying the amount of time each platform remains active. For added challenge, it might be interesting to have the robber climb onto certain platforms, creating more direct interaction between the robber and the animals. This would intensify the gameplay and reduce the distance between the robber and the player's character, increasing the tension in each level.
