## Introduction

Chosen Story: The "Town Musicians of Bremen" (German: Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten) (http://www.gmsdinkelscherben.de/downloads/erasmus/bremen.pdf)

The basic premise is that four animals travel to Bremen to play in a band, and on the way to Bremen they encounter a house full of robbers. They enter the house, and essentially fight 
off the robbers. We took this basic premise, and used the four levels to represent each character, and they must collect the instruments to "defeat" the robbers. Basic controls consist 
of the use of arrow keys (left and right) to move back and forth, and the space bar to jump.

## Ideation and Prototyping

Most of our ideation and prototyping came from our preliminary design document (linked above) from our initial assignment for this project. We began to get our art style for the game
as we used AI to develop our sprites and level backgrounds. Furthermore, as mere extremely primitive inspiration, we also very briefly consulted the code we had used in class in the 
Mad Bomber example.
